1567188755,85febe6aad060c02bf924638f6dfc27f,Form,8,0,subj_info,NULL,comment,I may have made a mistake. John thought a bomb was in the box. I may have clicked 'pillow' instead. As soon as I clicked to continue%2C I glanced and thought the answer I marked was incorrect%2C but there was no way to go back. %0AMy first thought was since the 911 operator didn't dispatch anyone%2C there was no taxpayer money "wasted". If the operator was already working%2C the police were already working%2C etc.%2C no extra money was going out. I think of things like this when I hear people complain about others getting themselves into situations where the Coast Guard or some group like that has to be "called out". Well aren't they 'on duty' anyway? I can't think of any extra money being spent unless it may be extra fuel? The only extra money being paid would be if a special group had to be called in and paid for their services.%0AI have no idea if the survey is dealing with anything like this or not. But I just had to comment! %0A
